  This code aims to create circles in an efficient way, using a minimal number of triangles in a taken circle with n vertices
  
  It was writen in JS, using p5.library, perhaps its universal and can be translated in many others interfaces.
  
  Exemple with 3 vertices:

  Exemple with 7 vertices:

  Exemple with 100 vertices:

  Using the noline function in the render, it can looks smoother. ;) -- Feel free to submit changes in the project.
